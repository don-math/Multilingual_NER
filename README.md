# multilingual-NER

In this project, we practice named entity recognition in 4 different languages: English, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese with the assistance of Meta AI's XLM-R model. We find that cross lingual transfer learning attains much better performances among western languages than their oriental counterparts. Fine-tuning on all languages has improved the performance of the model on almost all languages except English. Possible explanations are also provided.
